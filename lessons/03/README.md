# Lesson 3

In this lesson, you will learn how to use Umpire to allocate memory. 

If you want to access memory through Umpire, you will need an `umpire::Allocator`.
The `umpire::Allocator` is a C++ object that you can use to allocate
and deallocate memory; you can get information about it by querying its pointer.

All `umpire::Allocator` objects are created and managed by Umpireâ€™s
`umpire::ResourceManager`. So, in order to create an `umpire::Allocator`, you will
 first need get a handle to an `umpire::ResourceManager` instance. 
 For example,

 ```
auto& rm = umpire::ResourceManager::getInstance();
```

You can then request the Allocator corresponding to the desired
memory resource (here, "HOST") using the `getAllocator` function:

```
auto allocator = rm.getAllocator("HOST");
```

Passing the "HOST" memory resource to `getAllocator` is always an option, but 
other possible options might include "DEVICE" (global GPU memory), "DEVICE_CONST"
 (constant GPU memory), "UM" (unified memory, including CPU & GPU resources), and
 a few others.

Once you've created an `umpire::Allocator`, you can use it to allocate memory:


```
void* memory = allocator.allocate(1024);
```

and deallocate:


```
allocator.deallocate(memory)
```

For more information about allocators and methods for the Allocator class, you 
can check the the Umpire documentation:

https://umpire.readthedocs.io/en/develop/sphinx/tutorial/allocators.html

## Exercise

The file `three.cpp` contains some `TODO:` comments where you can add code to allocate and
deallocate memory.

Once you have made your changes, you can compile and run the lesson:

```
$ make three
$ ./bin/three
Address of data: 0x?????
```
